          It is CRAZY how fast the year has flown by with you!
          I remember it was just a year ago that I asked you if you wanted to be my girlfriend hahaha.
          You've always asked when did I know I love you and wanted you to be my girlfriend.
          I knew I love you because every time I get a text from you or when we talk I get this nice warm fuzzy 
          feeling inside of me. I still get that feeling every time we talk or text!
        </p> 
        <p class="letter">
          Its been a year so let's take a trip down memory lane for the memorable moments for us in the past year!

        <h3>Our First Date!</h3>
          <p class="letter">
            Of course our first date at CoCo Ichibanya! I was so shy and nervious because I taking someone so pretty like you out.
            I didn't even know I would be taking my future girlfriend out on a date that day. I our exact order, I ordered the 
            chicken katsu with less rice and you ordered the pork katsu curry. Then afterwards I was exposed as a swiftie and went to get
            ice cream at  Wonderlust but the line was too long so we went to Handel's instead. And on the way back we sang to the songs from my throwback playlists hahaha.

        <h3>Santa Monica Date</h3>
        <p class="letter">
          Our first date at Santa Monica! I remember I was so excited to take you out to Santa Monica because on our first date you said you always wanted to go see.
          I remember we went to the LACMA and looked at all the artwork together and making silly comments about them.
          I wish we would've told the guy to take a picture of us at the pier because that would've been a nice picture to have.
          It was also the first day we held hands and had our first kiss!
